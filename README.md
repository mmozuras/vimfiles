# Usage

Clone this repo into your home directory. Such as:

    git clone git://github.com/mmozuras/vimfiles.git ~/.vim

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used for plugin managment.
Run `:PlugInstall` to install plugins.

Now you should create a new <tt>.vimrc</tt> file in your home directory that
loads the pre-configured one that comes bundled in this package. You can do it
on Linux/Mac like this:

    echo "source ~/.vim/vimrc" > ~/.vimrc

This way you can override the default configuration by adding your own inside
this file.
